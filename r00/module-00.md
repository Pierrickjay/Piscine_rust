# Module 00: Hello, World!

## Introduction

The Rust programming language is still fairly new: its `1.0` release is younger than 42 itself! For
this reason, please understand that the knowledge acquired here may become obsolete at some point.
Though this is true for most programming languages, Rust is still updated quite regularly (almost
on a monthly basis) and you should be aware of that. Never stop learning.

At times, Rust might feel a bit hard to get into, may it be its syntax, the borrow checker, or
more generally, the number of details it requires the developer to think about when writing code.
Trust the compiler. It is always (in 99% of cases) right - even when it complains for apparently
nothing. Plus it is pretty well known to provide really good error messages. Read the errors,
correct your code, and get over it!

Internet can provide lots of resources to learn the Rust programming language, but I must advice
you to primarily focus on the official documentation. It contains the most up-to-date information
about this rapidly evolving language.

The general rules allow you to modify lint levels. Specifically, you may need to allow dead code.
The Rust compiler often tries to warn you about unused functions, and you will probably have some
of those during this Piscine.

```rust
// When it makes sense, you may add the `pub` modifier.
pub fn my_useful_function() {}

// Otherwise, you may add this at the begining of your
// files to silence those warnings ...
#![allow(dead_code)]

// ... or simply before any unused functions.
#[allow(dead_code)]
fn unused_function() {}
```

## General Rules

Any program you turn in must compile *without warnings* using the `rustc` compiler available on
the school's machines without additional options. You are allowed to use attributes to modify lint
levels, but you must be able to explain why you did so. You are *not* allowed to use `unsafe` code
anywhere in your code (not until the last module ;p).

For exercises using the `cargo` package manager, the same rule applies. In that case, only the
crates specified in the `allowed dependencies` section are allowed. Any other dependency is
forbidden. More generally, only the symbols specified in `allowed symbols` are authorized within an
exercise.

## Exercise 00: Hello, World!

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex00/

files to turn in:
    hello.rs

allowed symbols:
    std::println
```

What's a program without side effects?

Create a **program** that prints the string `Hello, World!`, followed by a line feed.

```txt
>_ ./hello
Hello, World!
```

## Exercise 01: Point Of No Return

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex01/

files to turn in:
    min.rs

allowed symbols:
    std::println
```

Create a `min` **function** that takes two integers, and returns the smaller one. To make the file
compile and for it to be testable, you must add a  `main` function to showing that your function is
indeed correct.

The function must be prototyped like this:

```rust
fn min(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32;
```

Oh, I almost forgot. The `return` keyword is forbidden! Good luck with that ~

## Exercise 02: yyyyyyyyyyyyyy

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex02/

files to turn in:
    yes.rs  collatz.rs  print_bytes.rs

allowed symbols:
    std::println  str::bytes
```

Imperative programming languages usually have some kind of statement to loop. Rust has several.

Create three **functions**. Each function must use one kind of loop supported by Rust, and you
cannot use the same loop kind twice.

The functions must be prototyped as follows:

```rust
fn yes() -> !;
fn collatz(start: u32);
fn print_bytes(s: &str);
```

The `yes` function must print the message `y`, followed by a line feed. It must do it
indefinitely.

```txt
y
y
y
y
y
y
y
...
```

The `collatz` function must execute the following algorithm...

* Let *n* be any natural number.
* If *n* is even, then *n* becomes *n*/2
* If *n* is odd, then *n* becomes 3*n* + 1

...until *n* equals 1. On each iteration, *n* must be displayed on the standard output, followed
by a line feed.

```txt
Input:
3

Output:
3
10
5
16
8
4
2
1
```

The `print_bytes` function must print every byte of the provided string.

```txt
Input:
"Hello!\n"

Output:
72
101
108
108
111
33
10
```

Once again, you must add `main` functions to prove that your functions are correct.

## Exercise 03: FizzBuzz

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex03/

files to turn in:
    fizzbuzz.rs

allowed symbols:
    std::{println, print}
```

This is the final exam of the C piscine. This is YOUR moment. You *can* do it. Problem: your
current subject is *FizzBuzz* and you're under so much stress right now that you forgot how to use
loops.

Create a Rust **program** that prints a C program on the standard output. That C program must play
the popular game *FizzBuzz* by itself without using any loop (for, while, do, etc.) statement. The
only allowed function is `write`.

The subject reads as follows:

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, each separated by a newline.
>
> If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints 'fizz' instead.
>
> If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints 'buzz' instead.
>
> If the number is both a multiple of 3 and a multiple of 5, it prints 'fizzbuzz' instead.

```txt
>_ ./fizzbuzz > fizzbuzz.c
>_ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror fizzbuzz.c
>_ ./a.out
1
2
fizz
4
buzz
...
```

If you feel like taking a little challenge, try to solve this execise wihthout using the regular
C-like `if`/`if else`/`else` statement. Rust provides other constructs to do just that without
having to go through that hassle.

## Exercise 04: Don't Panic

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex04/

files to turn in:
    dont_panic.rs

allowed symbols:
    std::panic
```

Unexpected events are to be expected in any computer application. Rust makes no *exception* to
that rule, and provides a way to "cleanly" crash a Rust program.

Create a Rust **program** that `panic!`s with the message `"I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON!!"`.

```txt
>_ ./dont_panic
thread 'main' panicked at 'I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON!!', dont_panic.rs:2:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

You can check with Valgrind that no memory has been lost (even though Rust allocates some blocks
before calling the `main` function).

## Exercise 05: Shipping With Cargo

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex05/

files to turn in:
    src/main.rs  Cargo.toml

allowed symbols:
    std::println
```

The Rust ecosystem relies heavily on its package manager, Cargo. Cargo is a program that is
responsible for managing the dependencies of a Rust application. It has many capabilities, but
these modules will only make use of a few of them.

Create a Rust **program** that prints the string `Hello, Cargo!`, followed by a line feed.

```txt
>_ cargo run
Hello, Cargo!
```

## Exercise 06: Unit Tests

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex06/

files to turn in:
    src/lib.rs  Cargo.toml

allowed symbols:
    std::{assert, assert_eq}
```

Testing a program is probably at least half the work of a developer. Every single function of any
digital system must be carefully tested to avoid as many crashes and unexpected behaviors as
possible.

```rust
fn fibs(n: u32) -> u32 {
    (0..n).fold((0, 1), |(a, b), _| (b, a + b)).0
}

fn is_prime(n: u32) -> bool {
    n >= 2 && !(2..n).any(|d| n % d == 0)
}
```

Copy the above functions, and write unit tests to determine whether those functions do work as
expected.

* The `fibs` function must compute the `n`-th term of the [fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number).
The first two terms of the sequence are `F0 = 0` and `F1 = 1`.

* The `is_prime` function returns whether `n` is a prime number.

In case of an error, the test should panic with an appropriate error message, but you are *not*
allowed to use the `panic!` macro. Instead, you can `assert!` that a specific value has been
properly returned.

```txt
>_ cargo test
running 7 tests
test zero_is_not_prime ... ok
test one_is_not_prime ... ok
test tree_is_prime ... ok
test four_is_not_prime ... ok
test first_fib_is_0 ... ok
test fifth_fib_is_3 ... ok
test seventeenth_fib_is_987 ... ok

test result: ok. 7 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 0 measured; 0 filtered out; finished in 0.00s

...
```

Note that the above is just an example. You are allowed to do the tests you want, but they must
properly check that those functions are actually correct.

## Exercise 07: The Price Is Right

```txt
turn-in directory:
    ex07/

files to turn in:
    src/main.rs  Cargo.toml

allowed dependencies:
    ftkit

allowed symbols:
    ftkit::*  std::println  std::cmp::Ordering  i32::cmp
```

To end this first module, why not try to create a simple game?

Create a **program** that allows its user to play the popular game show "The Price Is Right". The
game plays as follows:

1. The program randomly chooses an object whose price is unknown to the user. The name of the
object is displayed.
2. The user is prompted to bid the price of said object.
3. If the user is correct, the program ends with a message congratulating them.
4. Otherwise, a message indicates whether they overbid or underbid and the program is back to step 2.

Example:

```txt
>_ cargo run
Here is a fabulous 'cool ring'.
23
A 'cool ring' costs more than that!
57
A 'cool ring' isn't worth that much money!
34
Congrats! That 'cool ring' is worth $34.
```

To help you with that task, you are allowed to depend on the `ftkit` crate, which provides some
basic utility functions. Documentation for that library is available [here](https://docs.rs/ftkit).
